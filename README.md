### Inspiration
We've seen so many Resume review tools online, but we find them super helpful for improving and tailoring our Resume for job applications, and ultimately, career growth. However, as students, we still find that we are overwhelmed when trying to grow our career because there is so much we need to do. We want to understand not just how to improve our resume, but also how to improve ourselves so we can target specific goals (such as a company, career, or title).

### What it does
Our project ResuMAX gives students a clear plan to not just improve their resumes, but improve themselves as applicants. It uses specific information such as school, major, career goals, etc. to recommend courses to take, student organizations to join, etc. to help students take precise actions and achieve their dreams.

### How we built it
We utilized AWS services, cloudflare, NVIDIA GPUs, vscode, and AI tools to build a fully integrated infrastructure connecting different services to one another.

### Challenges we ran into
Many AWS services we wished to use, and were promoted in this event, could not be used because we lacked the quota allowed. This massively wasted our time as we attempted to navigate support and alternative services to build out application.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to navigate and learn a lot about AWS and AI on the spot. under the time crunch, ad that we were able to chain together many services together.

### What we learned
How to use AWS, fine tune models, and how to deploy a full app.
