Our founders sought to form a society that would consist of men who combined in the most equal proportion the gentleman, the scholar, and the jolly good fellow. This remains our criteria to this day. We aspire to be a highly respected fraternity, focused on excellent chapter performance, populated with men of distinction whose behavior is exemplary in all respects and who go on to become leaders in their chosen fields of endeavor. To this end, we conduct ourselves according to our DEKE values: Dignity: As gentlemen, we conduct ourselves in a dignified manner and value everyone equally. Excellence: As scholars, we pursue our academic and professional endeavors dutifully, honestly, and to the best of our ability. Kindness: As jolly good fellows, we are friendly, generous, and considerate. Esteem: To earn the esteem of others, we first show respect and admiration for them. Our policies and educational programs challenge members to be better men, to embrace the values of diversity and inclusion, and to create safe environments where all members are heard and where the social and physical wellbeing of all individuals are protected. DKE is more than just a place to live while an undergraduate. Our members, from the day they join DKE, are afforded the opportunity to form lifelong friendships, grow as a person through fraternal and collegiate experiences, and graduate ready to find success in all facets of life. We reward academic excellence. Because of the generosity of our alumni, we have funds within the UW Foundation and the Deke Foundation from which our members can receive scholarships to cover tuition or pursue other academic interests. We view giving back to the community a staple of fraternity life. As former President George H.W. Bush (himself a Deke) noted, &ldquo;there could be no definition of success that does not include service to others.&rdquo; Many of our members find helping those in need one of the most rewarding experiences of membership in Delta Kappa Epsilon. We reinforce the importance of health and wellbeing by having an officer whose responsibilities include bringing in speakers to present on topics such as stress management, good sleeping habits, and alcohol education. Finally, our fully renovated chapter house, located on the corner of 18th Avenue NE and NE 47th Street, has the amenities a modern fraternity requires and is wonderfully served by a bricked-in courtyard.

Husky Coding Project,HCP,Engineering,To create an internship-like environment that promotes the growth and development of our club members by providing project-based experiences on larger teams and encouraging peer-to-peer learning.,"The Problem New Programmers Face Getting software development internships is extremely difficult, especially for non-CS majors. Unfortunately, the best way to improve your odds of getting an internship is to be a CS major OR have a prior internship. This circular logic of needing the experience to get experience is extremely frustrating and discourages hundreds of non-CS majors from pursuing software development. While the obvious solution is to provide more projects through CS coursework for non-CS majors, most of these projects are completed solo or in pairs. As a result, students are missing out on working in larger teams, which is more common in the industry. In addition, the non-major CS coursework often does not teach the proper design workflow that SDEs in tech follow, which is a crucial skill that aspiring SDEs should practice before entering the workforce. What is the Solution We Offer? We aim to break the never-ending circular logic of ""needing experience to get experience"" that plagues new programmers that are trying to be qualified for jobs or internships. We do so by organizing members into teams that develop large-scale programming projects that simulate an internship-like environment through our club. As a result, our members can acquire the experiences they need to succeed in their future endeavors as a team. In addition, we foster a judgment-free, safe, and educational environment that prioritizes the learning experience over the stress of grades and school.

Mind to Mind ,M2M,"Political/Social Action, Special Interest",Mind to Mind: Caring for Connection,"Social isolation and loneliness is highly associated with poor health outcomes, and is exacerbated by conditions like substance use disorder and co-occurring psychiatric disorders. Environmental factors and stressors associated with living unhoused often lead to development of these conditions, exposing unhoused individuals to a disproportionate risk of social isolation and loneliness, thereby promoting decline of physical and behavioral health. Mind to Mind is an organization focused on bridging this gap, curating an environment for genuine connection forming through facilitated conversation between participant unhoused individuals and volunteer members. This goal will be accomplished by collaborating with surrounding shelters and housing programs, creating joint regular events for volunteers to visit shelters and speak to participants. These conversations will allow participants to share their story and allow volunteers a more grounded insight into the reality of living unhoused. Through these conversations, we will highlight the lived realities of unhoused individuals, create a more empathetic understanding of the lived experiences of our participants, and lobby support towards initiatives geared towards improving the livelihoods of individuals living in unstable environments."

In the years since the establishment of the council, MGC is now home to 13 active Greek organizations that span across Asian, Latinx, and progressive interests. Built upon the three pillars of Community, Culture, and Academics, members of MGC continually display qualities symbolic of these, while representing the excellence of their respective chapters. As the council expands in size, the Multicultural Greek Council will continue to provide a safe and inclusive space for the expression of diverse opinions and meaningful social relationships. Greek life at UW is made up of four Greek Councils: Interfraternity Council (IFC), Panhellenic Association, National Panhellenic Association, and Multicultural Greek Council (MGC). Unlike traditional IFC or Panhellenic fraternities and sororities that mandate their membership to reside in furnished houses on Greek Row, MGC&rsquo;s relatively young status at the University of Washington justifies why many chapters do not have permanent residences. Yet, through numerous social calendar events throughout the year, MGC organizations strive to promote an active campus presence while demonstrating the power of unity among multicultural Greeks with the wider Greek and UW community."

Our goal is to provide the UW community with the knowledge and resources needed to protect themselves and others from the epidemic. Our motto is: ""Empowerment through education. Prevention through action"" NARCARE seeks to prevent opioid overdose deaths by distributing naloxone&mdash; a drug that can reverse an overdose &mdash; and spreading awareness on overdose prevention on campus, in the U-District area, and around Seattle. Despite its well-known and obvious effectiveness, most people do not have easy access to naloxone and do not know how to administer it. That is why we offer trainings on how to recognize and prevent overdoses. Our events bring together activists, scholars, policymakers, and others who are working on addressing the crisis, so that our members can learn from them. These events help tackle stigma and misinformation. NARCARE was founded by a group of UW students who wanted to counter the despair and apathy associated with the seemingly inexorable opioid overdose crisis. Our efforts were galvanized by the loss of a close friend by one of our founders and by an overdose death that occurred in the Art Building at the University of Washington. Opioid overdoses are often the culmination of larger issues, such as poverty, addiction disorders, deteriorating mental health, and the homelessness crisis. Therefore, we will collaborate with organizations that are addressing these issues, such as local and state government agencies, universities, health clinics, homeless shelters, and many more. Our efforts are guided by the fact that overdose deaths are preventable. By empowering students, community members, businesses, and organizations with naloxone and overdose prevention awareness, we can reduce this needless loss of lives."

We meet to study and carve traditional Coast Salish style paddles, songs, and dances under the watchful eye of our elders. With all carving done by hand, Canoe Family at UW meets weekly at the ASU Shellhouse. This group calls for great patience and dedication as students start with blanks of yellow cedar and work their way to a canoe paddle. Compiled carving kits, paddle designs and blanks are all provided by the Canoe Family at UW. In addition to paddle carving classes, we also have socials, educational programming, gifting ceremonies and many more including our yearly Tribal canoe journey."
